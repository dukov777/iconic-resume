# My Resume, in HTML

This is my resume, written with HTML, generated by the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) framework.

Why HTML? It is for [separation of concerns (SoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), in particular separation of resume content with formatting. The two parts are completely separated. The resume content is all written in [_config.yml](/_congfig.yml). The styles are all defined in [style.scss](/style.scss).

Writing resume with word processors like Microsoft Word is painful. Once you decide to add or delete some contents, format can be totally disturbed and you have to re-arrange stuff. On the other hand, LaTeX is less flexible and hard to customize. 

## Usage

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

3. Write your resume entries `_config.yml`.
4. `cd` to repository. Run `jekyll s`. Go to `localhost:4000`.
5. Right click the page and click `print...` to save your resume in PDF.
