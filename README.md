# My Resume, in HTML

<img src="/screenshot.png" alt="resume screenshot" width="650">

This is my resume, written with HTML, generated by the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) framework.

Why HTML? It is for [separation of concerns (SoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), in particular separation of resume content with formatting. Writing resume with word processors like Microsoft Word is painful. Once you decide to add or delete some contents, format can be totally disturbed and you have to re-arrange stuff. On the other hand, LaTeX is less flexible and hard to customize. With HTML/CSS, the two parts can be completely separated. The resume content is all written in [_config.yml](/_config.yml). The styles are all defined in [style.scss](/style.scss).

## Usage

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).
2. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
3. Write your resume entries `_config.yml`.
4. `cd` to repository. Run `jekyll s`. 
5. Go to `localhost:4000`.
6. Right click the page and click `print...` to save your resume in PDF.
